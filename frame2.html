         Hello! I'm Mareeswaran, a passionate and driven IT professional with a strong foundation in technology and software development.

I completed my BSc in Information Technology at GVN College in 2023, where I gained a solid understanding of computer systems, programming, and data management. My academic journey has fueled my interest in the ever-evolving field of software development, leading me to further enhance my skills through a Full-Stack Development course with a focus on Java.

Currently, I am honing my expertise in both front-end and back-end development, learning to create dynamic, user-friendly web applications. I'm particularly interested in building scalable, efficient systems using Java and other cutting-edge technologies.

My goal is to continue learning, stay updated with the latest industry trends, and contribute to innovative, high-impact projects in the software development space. I'm excited about the opportunities ahead to work on challenging projects and collaborate with others in this dynamic field.

Feel free to explore my portfolio and contact me for any collaboration opportunities! </p>
